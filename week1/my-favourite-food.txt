Here’s a classic Ghormeh Sabzi (Persian Herb Stew) recipe — one of the most beloved Iranian dishes!

 Ingredients (serves 4–6)

Herbs (finely chopped):

2 cups parsley

1 cup cilantro

1 cup chives or green onions (green parts only)

½ cup fenugreek leaves (fresh or dried; use less if dried)

Other ingredients:

500 g (1 lb) lamb or beef, cut into small cubes

1 large onion, finely chopped

1½ cups red kidney beans (cooked or canned)

2–3 dried limes (limoo amani), pierced with a fork

1½ tsp turmeric

Salt and black pepper to taste

3 tbsp vegetable oil (for frying herbs)

2 tbsp oil (for frying onions/meat)

3 cups water (or enough to cover)

Instructions

Fry the herbs:
In a large pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil and sauté all chopped herbs over medium heat for about 10–15 minutes until fragrant and dark green. Set aside.

Cook the meat:
In a large pot, heat 2 tbsp of oil. Add onions and sauté until golden.
Add turmeric and meat; cook until the meat is browned on all sides.

Combine:
Add the fried herbs, dried limes, kidney beans, salt, and pepper.
Pour in water to cover everything.

Simmer:
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently for 2–3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the stew thickens.

Taste and adjust:
Add salt or a touch of lemon juice if you like more tanginess.

 To serve

Serve hot with steamed rice (chelo) — the perfect traditional pairing.
