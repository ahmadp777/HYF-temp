My second favourite food is Dizi — a classic, hearty Persian lamb and chickpea stew.

 Ingredients (serves 4–6)

500 g lamb (preferably with some bone or fat)

1 large onion, chopped

1 cup chickpeas (soaked overnight)

½ cup white beans (optional, also soaked overnight)

2–3 medium potatoes, peeled and halved

2–3 tomatoes, chopped or 2 tbsp tomato paste

2–3 dried limes (limoo amani), pierced with a fork

1 tsp turmeric

Salt and black pepper to taste

5–6 cups water

2–3 tbsp oil

 Instructions

Prepare the base:
In a large pot, heat the oil and sauté the onions until golden.
Add turmeric and stir for about a minute.

Add the meat:
Add the lamb pieces and brown them lightly on all sides.

Add legumes and water:
Add soaked chickpeas and beans, then pour in the water.
Bring to a boil, skim off any foam, and reduce to a simmer.

Add other ingredients:
Add tomatoes (or tomato paste), dried limes, salt, and pepper.
Cover and cook on low heat for 2–3 hours until the meat and legumes are tender.

Add potatoes:
Add potatoes and cook for another 30–40 minutes until soft.

 Serving Dizi the traditional way

Separate the broth:
Pour the liquid part of the stew into bowls — this is the abgoosht (broth).
Serve it with pieces of flatbread (lavash or sangak) to soak up the broth.

Mash the solids:
Mash the meat, potatoes, and beans together using a pestle (goosht-koob) or fork.
This mashed mixture is called “goosht-e kubideh” — eat it with more bread, pickles, and fresh herbs.
